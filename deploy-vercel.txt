IMEX-TEK GLOBAL LTD — Vercel Deploy (Simple, kid-friendly)
==========================================================

Before you start:
- Make sure your folder (imextek-portfolio) has:
  index.html
  styles.css
  assets/logo.png

Part A — Make the folder and add files
1. Create a folder on your Desktop named: imextek-portfolio
2. Put the files inside that folder (index.html, styles.css, assets folder with logo.png)

How to create folder & files (Windows):
- Right-click Desktop -> New -> Folder -> name it "imextek-portfolio"
- Open the folder, right-click -> New -> Text Document -> rename to index.html (remove .txt)
- Paste the index.html content into it and save.
- Repeat for styles.css and README.txt.
- Create a new folder inside called "assets" and copy your logo image into it. Rename logo file to logo.png.

On Mac:
- On Desktop click File -> New Folder -> name it imextek-portfolio
- Open it, right-click -> New File (or use TextEdit and Save As -> index.html). Make sure Save As: Plain Text.
- Create "assets" folder inside and add logo.png.

Part B — Deploy to Vercel (drag & drop; easiest)
1. Open browser, go to https://vercel.com
2. Click "Sign Up" -> Continue with Google (or GitHub)
3. Once logged in, go to https://vercel.com/new
4. Scroll down to the "Deploy a Project" section that has "Drag and Drop"
5. Drag the whole imextek-portfolio folder onto that box (or click to select)
6. Vercel will upload and deploy automatically.
7. After a short moment you'll see "Deployment Complete" and a link like:
   https://imextek-portfolio-xxxxx.vercel.app
8. Click the link to open your live site (it is HTTPS and free).

Part C — Update after changes
- If you edit files locally, redeploy by dragging the updated folder again to the Vercel page OR
- Better: push to GitHub and connect repo to Vercel for automatic deploys (see Part D).

Part D — (Optional) Deploy using GitHub for automatic updates
1. Create a GitHub account and new repository (name: imextek-portfolio).
2. Upload the folder files to the repo (or use Git to push).
3. In Vercel click "New Project" -> Import Git Repository -> choose your repo -> Deploy.
4. Now every time you push to main branch, Vercel redeploys automatically.

Part E — Make contact form work (Formspree)
1. Go to https://formspree.io and sign up (free).
2. Create a new form. It will produce an endpoint like:
   https://formspree.io/f/abcd1234
3. Open index.html in a text editor, find the form tag:
   action="https://formspree.io/f/yourformid"
   Replace with your new endpoint, save file.
4. Redeploy (drag folder again or push to GitHub). Test by sending a message.

Part F — Add a custom domain (if you have one)
1. On Vercel dashboard open your project -> Settings -> Domains -> Add
2. Type your domain (example: eximtek.com) and follow the DNS instructions shown.
3. At the domain registrar, add the DNS records Vercel asks for (they provide exact values).
4. Wait a few minutes to a few hours for DNS to propagate.

Testing checklist:
- Open the Vercel URL -> site loads (logo visible)
- Click "Get Started" scrolls to contact
- Click WhatsApp opens chat with +2348166757206
- Submit contact form -> check your email (after Formspree setup)

If anything breaks:
- Check file names (index.html must be exactly named)
- Make sure logo file path is assets/logo.png (exact)
- Clear browser cache or open in private/incognito
- Tell me the exact error and I’ll fix it with exact text to paste.
